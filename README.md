# Land Explorer Hook Runner

A very simple task runner, adapted from https://github.com/DigitalCommons/hook-runner-targets. It deploys new code for the LX front-end, back-end and static sites to the staging server via webhooks defined in the config.

To deploy this hook runner, upload the files in `/www` to `/var/www/hook-runner` on the LX staging server.
